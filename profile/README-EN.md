# We're moving! ðŸ‘‹

Our repositories has been migrated from GitHub to our new Git site, created in collaboration with [@Future-Studios](https://github.com/Future-Studios).

### Why did we move?

We decided to move all of our repositories to our own Git site for various reasons:

- More control: Having our own Git site gives us more control over the repository and its access. We can customize the settings according of our repositories to our needs and requirements.

- Security: Our Git site provides us with better security features and controls. We can set up multi-factor authentication, access control, and other security measures to keep our repositories safe.

Our new Git site can be found at [here](https://git.future-studios.net/). We encourage you to update your bookmarks and clone the repository from our new site.

### Issues and Pull Requests

If you have any open issues or pull requests on our repositories, we have migrated them to our new Git site. You can continue to track and comment on these items at our new site.

### How to access the "new" repositories?

To access our repositories, you can visit our Git site at https://git.future-studios.net/ and search for the repository name. You can clone the repository using the `git clone` command and start working on it.
How to contribute?

If you would like to contribute to our repositories, please follow these steps:

- Fork the repository on our Git site.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.
- Make the necessary changes to the code.
- Push the changes to your forked repository using the `git push` command.
- Submit a pull request on our Git site for review.

###  Updating Local Clones

If you have already cloned a repositories, you will need to update your local clone to point to the new Git site. You can do this by running the following command in your local repository:

```
git remote set-url origin https://git.future-studios.net/
```
Once you have updated your local clone, you can continue to use Git as you normally would.

### Conclusion

We believe that moving the repository to our own Git site is the best decision for us in terms of control, security, and cost. We hope that this transition will be smooth for all our contributors, and we look forward to your continued support.
